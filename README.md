User should save all of the files in the same folder. User can simply run the ```NumericalSimulation.m``` since the rates are available as ```Beta.csv``` and ```Alpha.csv``` after the computation done in ```RatesEstimation.m```. 

To change the lockdown parameters, edit lines 22-24 in the ```NumericalSimulation.m```.
